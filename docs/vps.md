## **What is VPS?** ##
Virtual Private Server (VPS), is a virtualized server environment created by partitioning a physical server into multiple isolated virtual servers. Each VPS functions independently with its own operating system, resources, and configurations. It provides users with greater control, flexibility, and scalability compared to shared hosting, allowing them to install and run custom software, manage their server settings, and allocate resources according to their needs. VPS hosting is commonly used for hosting websites, applications, and other online services, offering a balance between affordability and performance.
