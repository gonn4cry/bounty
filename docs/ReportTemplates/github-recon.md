# **Github Recon**

### **Vulnerability Name**

Sensitive information exposed on GitHub

### **Vulnerability Description**

A public GitHub repository of an organization containing the source code of an internal application can inadvertently leak sensitive information when developers mistakenly include credentials, API keys, or configuration files with sensitive data, such as database passwords, in the codebase.&#x20;

If these secrets are not properly secured or if the repository is misconfigured, they become accessible to anyone, including potential attackers, who can exploit this information to gain unauthorized access to the organization's systems or data, potentially leading to data breaches, security vulnerabilities, or other detrimental consequences.

> **Add your specific vulnerability description if required, the one given above is a general description.**

### **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Go to _\[Exposed Github Repository Link]_.
2. Observe the sensitive data exposed.

### **POC**

> **Modify the steps to reproduce above if required. Attach snapshots (POC) or a video link here.**

### **Impact**

Attackers, armed with exposed credentials and configuration data, can infiltrate the organization's systems, manipulate or steal data, disrupt services, or exploit vulnerabilities, potentially leading to legal and regulatory repercussions.

> **Add your specific impact if required, the one given above is a general impact.**

### **Remediation**

* Implement proper .gitignore files to exclude sensitive files, such as configuration files and secrets, from being committed to the repository.
* Avoid hardcoding secrets in code. Instead, use a secrets management tool or environment variables to securely store and retrieve credentials and API keys.
* Regularly scan your codebase with automated security analysis tools that can identify and flag potential vulnerabilities, including exposed secrets.
* Restrict access to the repository to only authorized personnel. Utilize GitHub's repository access controls and team permissions to limit who can view and modify the code.

> **Add your specific remediation if required, the above is a general remediation.**
